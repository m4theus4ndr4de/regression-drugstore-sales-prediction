<h1>Drugstore Sales Prediction</h1>

<p align="justify">This is a fictional project for studying purposes. The business context and the insights are not real. 
The dataset is from Rossmann, a large drug store chain in Europe with many stores all over the continent. The dataset is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Description of the Business Problem</h2>

<p align="justify">The CEO from Rossmann wants to make some investments to renovate all stores and asked the managers of all the stores to say what the income of all the stores will be in the next 6 weeks so that he can decide how much to invest in each store based on that. All the managers asked the data department from Rossmann for a way to answear the CEO accurately. So, a regression model would be of great help.</p>

<h3>The tools that were created:</h3>

<p align="justify"><b>Machine Learning Regression Model: </b>Using the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, a machine learning regression model was created to be used for future predictions.</p> The notebook used to create the model is available <a href="https://github.com/m4theus4ndr4de/regression-rossmann/blob/main/store_sales_prediction.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Flask Prediction API: </b>The model is available on the Streamlit Cloud and can be acessible by an API created using Flask. The API source code is available <a href="https://github.com/m4theus4ndr4de/regression-rossmann/blob/main/webapp/handler.py" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Telegram Chat Bot: </b>A chat bot on Telegram (a desktop and messaging app) is available so that the CEO can send the id number of a store and the prediction of the sales for the next 6 weeks will be available there. You can clik <a href="https://t.me/DrugstoreSalesPredictionBOT" target="_blank">here</a> to check it out sending a number up to 4 digits. The Bot source code is available <a href="https://github.com/m4theus4ndr4de/regression-rossmann/blob/main/rossmann-telegram-api/rossmann-bot.py" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Business Premises</h2>

<h3>The premises that were assumed for the development of the business problem solution are:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The model will be available on Github, so the model file has to be smaller than 50 Mb.</li>
<li>Extra assortment is greater tha extended and basic.</li>
<li>Stores that have no competitors in the dataset (CompetitionDIstance and CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year] not available) were interpreted as stores that have no competitors near them.</li>
<li>The number 200000 was considered as a good one to replace the NA values on the column CompetitionDistance for stores with no competitors meaning that the nearest competitor is very far.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Solution Strategy</h2>

<ol>
<li>Understand the Business problem.</li>
<li>Download the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</li>

<li>Explore the data to create hypothesis, think about a few insights and validate them.</li>
<li>Prepare the data to be used by the modeling algorithms encoding variables, splitting train and test dataset and other necessary operations.</li>
<li>Create the models using machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Evaluate the created models to find the one that best fits to your problem.</li>
<li>Tune the model to achieve a better performance.</li>
<li>Deploy the model in production so that it is available to the user.</li>
<li>Find possible improvements to be explored in the future.</li>

<h2>6. Machine Learning Modeling</h2>

<p align="justify">The final result of this project is a regression model. Therefore, some machine learning models were created. In all, 5 models were created, one of them is a simple model that calculates the average sales to serve as a comparison with machine learning models. The other models initially created were Linear Regression, Regularized Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.</p>

<p align="justify">The Boruta algorithm was used to select features for the model and 18 features were selected to the final model. The models were evaluated considering three metrics, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The initial models performances are in the table below.</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr><th>Model Name</th><th>MAE</th><th>MAPE</th><th>RMSE</th></tr>
<tr><td>Random Forest Regressor</td><td>680.19</td><td>0.10</td><td>1008.96</td></tr>
<tr><td>XGBoost Regressor</td><td>874.26</td><td>0.13</td><td>1256.33</td></tr>
<tr><td>Average Model</td><td>1354.80</td><td>0.46</td><td>1835.14</td></tr>
<tr><td>Linear Regression</td><td>1867.09</td><td>0.29</td><td>2671.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lasso</td><td>2198.58</td><td>0.34</td><td>3110.51</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>7. Final Model</h2>

<p align="justify">To decide which would be the final model, a cross-validation was carried out to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in a more robust way. These metrics are represented in the table below.</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr><th>Model Name</th><th>MAE</th><th>MAPE</th><th>RMSE</th></tr>
<tr><td>Random Forest Regressor</td><td>837.52 +/- 216.76</td><td>0.12 +/- 0.02</td><td>1254.42 +/- 316.65</td></tr>
<tr><td>XGBoost Regressor</td><td>1069.47 +/- 139.48</td><td>0.15 +/- 0.02</td><td>1523.41 +/- 182.76</td></tr>
<tr><td>Linear Regression</td><td>2081.73 +/- 295.63</td><td>0.3 +/- 0.02</td><td>2952.52 +/- 468.37</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lasso</td><td>2388.68 +/- 398.48</td><td>0.34 +/- 0.01</td><td>3369.37 +/- 567.55</td></tr>
</table>

<p align="justify">The Random Forest model was the best among all the models created. However, XGBoost was chosen to be deployed because it tends to take up less disk space than Random Forest. After choosing which would be the final model, a random search hyperparameter optimization was used to improve the performance of the model. The final model evaluation metrics are in the table below.</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr><th>Model Name</th><th>MAE</th><th>MAPE</th><th>RMSE</th></tr>
<tr><td>XGBoost Regressor</td><td>653.39</td><td>0.10</td><td>956.03</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify">The XGBoost prediction model was chosen because it can be trained faster than a Random Forest model using a GPU. The model used in deployment was not the best one, but it is considerably smaller than the others, because it has a smaller number of estimators, and the error metrics are not so distant from the best model. A chat bot that answears the income for the next 6 weeks was also developed to work like a hands on tool. Now, the CEO can have access easily to the income of each store by simple sending a message to the chat bot.</p>

<h2>9. Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Develop some more features to the bot.</li>
<li>Create an options menu to the Telegram Bot.</li>
<li>Develop a model to determine the profit of the next day, month and year.</li>
<li>Improve model prediction capabilities by adding new features.</li>
<li>Search for stores with a high prediction error and find a way to enhance the predition of them.</li>
<li>Try other machine learning algorithms.</li>
</ul>
